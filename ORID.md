    1. createContext
    2. Provider
    3. useContext
4. Reducer: State management
    1. useReducer

**I:**

- Today, I learned about the React lifecycle and how to manage state. We can share and modify data between multiple components using Context and Reducer, which helps solve the problem from the previous day of passing states around too chaotically between components.
- Today's presentation was great. Everyone in the team did a fantastic job and showed a lot of effort. I look forward to the next presentation.

- When encountering different knowledge points while learning React, it's important to promptly search for resources online to resolve confusion.
- Summarize the actions left over from the retro and execute them.
