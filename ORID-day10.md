**I:**

- Today I mainly learned how to use React to request backend APIs, and practiced by modifying the data source of the Day9 project to make the data truly come from the backend.
- I also received the topic for the next presentation. This time, everyone agreed that we need to prepare early. After class, everyone actively discussed the content, and I believe our progress and quality will be much faster than last time.

**D:**

- Prepare the PPT content and finish making the PPT in advance.
- Summarize React notes, and create a content map during the learning process to help organize key points.
